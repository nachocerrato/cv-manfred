    "goodPractices": "I always try to apply development practices focused on scalability and code quality whenever possible. Some of them include:\n\n- **Clean Architecture and Onion Architecture**: I design applications with a clear layered structure, which facilitates maintenance and scalability. This approach allows for changes without affecting the business logic.\n\n- **SOLID Principles**: I apply these principles to maintain organized and easily testable code.\n\n- **Automated Testing**: I developed unit and integration tests (xUnit) to ensure correct functionality and a high standard of quality.\n\n- **Continuous Refactoring**: I participate in system modernization, applying Clean Code techniques to improve readability and align it with current standards.\n\n- **CI/CD with Azure DevOps**: I use CI/CD with Azure DevOps for version control and automated deployments, optimizing delivery times and reducing errors.",
