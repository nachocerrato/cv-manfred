    "desiredJobDescription": "My dream job currently is one that allows me to grow as a developer above all else. I am at a point where I need to prioritize interesting projects that provide me with experience and knowledge, and where best practices are genuinely taken into account. I also highly value a healthy work environment that fosters collective learning and teamwork.",
    "goodPractices": "I was very fortunate with the project where I made my debut as a developer. It allowed me to familiarize myself and follow good practices such as:\n\n+ Layered Architecture\n+ Development and maintenance of APIs documenting them\n+ Unit and integration testing\n+ Good version control practices with Git\n+ Agile methodologies and CI/CD\n\nOn the other hand, I always try to write code in the cleanest way possible and according to the SOLID principles that I know, and I try, whenever I can, to refactor both my code and that of less experienced colleagues to make the solutions more robust and sustainable.\n\nRegardless of this, I always try to keep learning and training myself as I can in relation to good development practices. I have already completed several courses on this subject and the latest has been the famous - and excellent - \"Clean Code\" by Uncle Bob, which I have been trying to put into practice in my day-to-day since I started the first page.",
