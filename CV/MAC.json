My main focus is on modernizing legacy systems. In one of the most significant projects, I am developing a solution from scratch in .NET 8 to replace an old application built with ASP.NET Web Forms.\n\nThis new system combines Onion Architecture, Clean Architecture principles, and SOLID design with a focus on Domain-Driven Design (DDD). DDD enables me to model business logic in a clear, domain-centric way, ensuring the domain layer is well-structured and easily maintainable. Additionally, I implement the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to manage the presentation layer, ensuring a clear separation between business logic, user interaction, and data presentation.\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n- Designing and developing new modules with a clear separation of responsibilities, encapsulating business logic in the domain layer following DDD principles and utilizing dependency injection for greater flexibility.\n- Implementing the Specification pattern to encapsulate business rules in data queries, improving maintainability and avoiding code duplication.\n- Configuring and integrating Entity Framework Core with a Code-First approach, defining database relationships and schemas using Fluent API.\n- Designing and updating views and pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, managing the data flow between the presentation layer and business logic through MVC and tools like Axios.\n"

    "desiredJobDescription": "My ideal job is one that allows me to grow as a developer, work on exciting projects, and apply best practices in a collaborative and team-oriented environment. I am looking for a role where continuous learning and code quality are top priorities.",
    "goodPractices": "In my daily work, I strive to apply practices that prioritize scalability and code quality. For example, I use architectures like Clean Architecture and Onion Architecture, which help me organize code into well-defined layers, making changes easier to implement without compromising business logic.\n\nI also rely on SOLID principles to ensure a more structured design and facilitate software testing and evolution. I am a strong advocate for automated testing (both unit and integration tests), as they ensure everything works as it should and maintain a high standard of quality.\n\nAnother key aspect of my work is continuous refactoring. I am always looking for opportunities to modernize systems, apply Clean Code techniques, and improve code readability, adapting it to current needs. Additionally, I have incorporated Domain-Driven Design (DDD) into my projects to ensure that the software structure clearly reflects the business domain.\n\nFinally, I enjoy optimizing workflows using CI/CD with Azure DevOps. This allows me to automate deployments and manage version control, reducing errors and speeding up delivery times.",
